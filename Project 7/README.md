§ You could also include:

· how `run-app-only.sh` script fits into the picture

· how it is possible to speed up the automation process if you are limited on time (i.e. think about at which stage images could be used)

o Detailed steps on what you did and why

o Blockers – Suggestion: what was the issue, reason for the issue, solution

o What you learnt
